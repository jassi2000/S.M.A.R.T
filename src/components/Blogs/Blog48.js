Statistics can be misleading if you don’t understand the base used for comparison.&nbsp;</span></li>

<li ><span >While the federal government has declared several fiscal packages to help the economy, keep an eye open for any additional financial assistance packages as they might speed up/ slow down the recovery process and impact the performance of the market in the near-term too.</span></li>
