            <h2>Why is P/B Ratio More Relevant for Banks Than P/E Ratio?</h2>
<p>There are many financial ratios that can help you determine the financial health of a bank like GNPA, NNPA, PCR, CAR, CASA, NIM, P/E, and P/B ratios. Each of these ratios provides certain insights into the bank’s financial strength. Today, we are going to focus on two commonly used financial ratios – P/E and P/B and look at the reasons that make P/B ratios more relevant to banks than P/E ratios.</p>
<h3>What are The P/E Ratio and P/B Ratio?</h3>
<p>The market price of the share of a company is an indicator of the way investors perceive it. If the investors feel that a company holds a lot of promise and can grow and earn good profits in the future, then they would want to buy its shares leading to an increase in its price.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, if a company is perceived to be in troubled waters, then investors tend to stay away and sell its stocks. While the market price of a share does not directly indicate the strength of the company, it is an indicator of the market’s perception.</p>
<p>1. P/E Ratio:</p>

<p>When you plan to buy a stock, you need to assess the company’s fundamentals and investor perception to make an informed decision. This is where the P/E Ratio helps.</p>
<p>A P/E or Price to Earnings Ratio is the ratio of the market price of a company’s stock to its earnings per share (EPS). In other words,</p>
<p>P/E Ratio = Market PriceEarning Per Share</p>
<p>2. P/B Ratio:</p>

<p>While the P/E Ratio is based on the company’s earnings, the P/B ratio takes its book value instead. </p>
<p>Book Value of a company is the net value of all its assets after deducting all liabilities. In other words,</p>
<p>Book Value = Total Assets-Total Liabilities</p>
<h3>Which Is More Relevant For Banks:  P/E Ratio or P/B Ratio?</h3>
<p>Around the world, a P/B Ratio is a more popular measure of valuation of a bank and/or financial services company compared to a P/E Ratio. Here are some reasons that make it more relevant:</p>
<p>1. It Helps Understand The Efficiency Of Fund Utilization</p>

<p>When you look at the P/B Ratio of a company, a low value usually indicates an undervalued stock and vice versa. However, the significance of the P/B Ratio changes for banks.</p>
<p>2. A Good Indicator Of Bank Spread</p>

<p>When you compare the financial performance of banks, assessing the bank spread is important. For most banks, the yield and cost of funds are similar. Hence, when a P/B Ratio is calculated, it depends upon the bank’s spread and its ability to keep the non-performing assets (NPAs) under control. </p>
<p>3. Offers A Picture Of A Bank Even If It Is Making Losses</p>

<p>A P/E Ratio makes sense only when a company is making profits. During loss-making periods since there are no earnings, this ratio becomes irrelevant. If you look at the loss-making banks, it is easy to observe that many such banks can be turned profitable by creating supporting conditions for spread. Further, banks have a long investment and gestation period. Hence, a P/B ratio is a better metric to assess the bank’s performance.</p>
<h3>P/B Ratio + ROE</h3>
<p>In banks, the P/B Ratio is the primary measure of valuation. However, you should not rely on this ratio alone to assess the financial health of a bank. When you use P/B Ratio in conjunction with ROE or Return on Equity Ratio, you can get a more effective analysis. This is because ROE + P/B Ratio offers a better insight into the growth prospects of the bank. An ROE Ratio that increases in tandem with the P/B Ratio is usually an indicator of a healthy company.</p>
