<h3>3. Select a Broker</h3>
<p>One of the first things to know when considering how to buy stocks online is you cannot trade shares directly. You can only invest in stocks through SEBI-registered brokers and investment platforms. </p>

<p>These intermediaries levy a brokerage charge to facilitate this service. It is either a flat fee or a percentage of the total transaction value. </p>

<p>Once the transaction is complete, you will receive the equivalent stock units in your DEMAT account. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are a few factors you may want to take into account when considering how to buy shares online.these are </p>

<h4>1. Company Details</h4>

<p>Financial experts strongly recommend investors to research on a company before deciding to purchase its stocks. It goes a long way in ensuring a well-informed decision. </p>

<p>Learn what the company does, know about the industry in which it operates, review its historical performance, check whether it’s currently profitable or not and how long its good run can sustain according to experts.</p>

<p>You may evaluate other aspects of the company that you think is relevant to returns as well. Some investment platforms feature detailed reports on companies that can be significantly beneficial to that end. </p>

<p>Besides a sound decision, this research will ensure you have an edge over other novice investors.  </p>

<h4>2. Beta</h4>

<p>A stock’s beta refers to the degree of volatility it demonstrates in relation to the overall market index. It may be wise to check the beta of a stock before you decide to buy it. </p>

<p>Any beta value over 1 signifies a more volatile price movement in regards to the underlying index. For instance, if a stock has a beta value of 1.2, it represents that a 100% change in the index will result in a 120% increase or decrease in its price. </p>

<p>Hence, any stock with a beta above 1 is of high risk. Conversely, an equity share having a low beta value is of low risk. </p>

<h4>3. P/E Ratio</h4>

<p>It denotes the relationship between a company’s current share price and earnings per share. The P/E ratio helps investors determine the value of stocks.</p>

<p>If a stock you are planning to buy features a P/E ratio of 30%, it signifies investors’ intent to pay Rs. 30 to earn Re. 1 of the company’s earnings. </p>

<p>There’s no good or bad P/E ratio, and it depends on the industry. Thus, compare P/E ratios of similar companies and also the rate at which the P/E ratios are growing before you buy stocks online.</p>

<h4>4. Dividend Payouts</h4>

<p>Analysing dividend payouts can signal a company’s financial health and growth stage. </p>

<p>Organisations that pay dividends inconsistently are often in their growing stages. These companies are poised to offer excellent capital gains to their investors. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it indicates a well-established financial footing and steady cash flow when the enterprise pays regular dividends. </p>

<p>However, these are merely assumptions based on popular trends and not tenets set on stones. </p>

<p>It’s wise not to interpret a company’s potential based on only one factor.  Consider utilising several metrics and relevant factors in conjunction to reach a well-rounded conclusion. </p>

<p>Doing so will position you better when you buy stocks online and allow you to invest successfully by optimising profitability.</p>
