            <h2>How do Mergers and Acquisitions Affect Stock Prices</h2>
<p>There are times when two companies decide to combine to form a stronger company in one form or another.</p> 
<p>While there are many ways in which two companies can combine, two of the most common processes are Mergers and Acquisitions.</p> 
<p>There are various reasons behind a company opting for a merger or agreeing to an acquisition like increasing the market share, geographical outreach, reducing competition, etc.</p> 
<p>In fact, this happens more often than we realize because, on most occasions, such mergers/acquisitions don’t make it to the headlines unless the companies involved are big and popular. </p>
<p>However, if a listed company undergoes a merger or is acquired by a larger company, then what happens to its stock price? Today, we will talk about mergers and acquisitions and analyze the way they can impact the stock prices of the companies involved in it.</p>
<h3>What are Mergers?</h3>
<p>A Merger is a voluntary act where two companies, of similar size and structure, decide to fuse into one new legal entity.</p> 
<p>It is important to remember that mergers usually happen between companies that are ‘equal’’ in many ways. Hence, when they form a new entity, rights and profit-sharing is decided mutually.</p> 
<p>Also, once they merge, the original companies dissolve and only the new company remains in existence. There are different types of mergers like:</p>
<p>Conglomerate – where two or more companies in unrelated business activities merge and create synergy to enhance value, save costs, and boost performance. In simpler terms, a conglomerate has companies that don’t have much in common.</p>
<p>Product Extension – where two companies operating in the same sector and having a similar target audience with the objective of creating a new entity with a wider range of products being offered to customers.</p>
<p>Market Extension – where two companies operating in the same sector but different markets come together to form a new company with access to a wider market and a bigger client base.</p>
<p>Horizontal Mergers – where two companies operating in the same sector with similar products and market form a new entity for more market control, reduce competition, and benefit from the economies of scale.</p>
<p>Vertical Mergers – where two companies at different stages of the product development/selling cycle merge to form a new entity that is more self-sufficient with a reduction in cost and increased synergies. Typically, vertical mergers happen between companies at different levels of a sector’s supply chain. For example, a manufacturer can vertically merge with a raw material provider to create a stronger company.</p>
<h3>What are Acquisitions?</h3>
<p>While mergers are between equals and voluntary, acquisitions are initiated by a larger company to absorb a smaller one. It is a process where the acquiring company purchases more than 50 percent of the acquiree or target company. Large companies acquire smaller ones for various reasons including:</p>
<p>Market Expansion – where a company acquires a small company in a market where it wants to expand its operations. Purchasing a running business can save it a lot of hassle and costs associated with setting up a new business in a new market.</p>
<p>Growth Strategy – where a large company that has reached its optimal limit of operations, logistics, resources, etc., then it might start looking at young and promising companies to acquire and incorporate into its revenue stream.</p>
<p>Reduce Competition – where a large company tries to acquire smaller ones in its sector to control the flow of products and services into the market. This helps reduce competition and keep the monopolistic competitive nature of the market alive.</p>
<p>Technological Advantage – where a large and established company acquires a young and technologically-driven one to benefit from new technologies. This is usually a faster and cost-efficient way to implement new technology.</p>
<p>When the target company does not consent to the acquisition, the process is usually called a Takeover.</p>
<h3>Effect of Mergers and Acquisitions on Stock Prices</h3>
<p>Every merger and/or acquisition is unique and can result in different effects on the stock prices of the participating companies. However, investors can keep their eyes open for certain identifiable patterns to make informed decisions about buying/selling the stocks of these companies. Here are some patterns that highlight the effects of mergers and acquisitions:</p>
<h3>1. Stock Price volatility :</h3>
<p>Whether two companies are merging or one is acquiring the other by, the stock prices of both the companies may become highly volatile.</p>
<p>The process of merger and acquisition is usually a long-drawn one where legalities, compliances, and finer details have to be taken care of before signing the dotted line. </p>
<h3>2. Impact on the stock prices of merging companies :</h3>
<p>During the process of the merger, the stock price of both the companies is impacted in different ways based on a range of factors like their market capitalizations, the merger process, and macroeconomic factors. </p>
<p>Usually, while the merging companies are similar in size and profitability, the company which gains an advantage due to the merger experiences a rise in stock prices.</p>
<p>The volatility in stock prices also leads to an increase in its trading volumes which further inflates the prices.</p> 
<h3>3. Impact on the stock price of the target company (in the case of acquisitions) :</h3>
<p>In an acquisition, the stock price of the target company usually increases. This is because most investors believe that in an acquisition, the acquiring company pays a premium to acquire the target company.</p>
<p> This assumption is based on the belief that an acquisition takes place only when both the acquirer and acquire benefit from the deal.</p> 
<h3>4. Impact on the stock price of the acquiring company (in the case of acquisitions) :</h3>
<p>In an acquisition, the market tends to choose favorites. In other words, investors tend to look for winners and losers in the proposed deal. Since the acquiring company is making the purchase, unless the profitability from the deal is not evident to the investors, the stock price of the acquiring company tends to get affected negatively.</p> 
<p>As explained above, the acquiring company pays higher than the current market price to acquire the target company. </p>
