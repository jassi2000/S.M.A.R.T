            <h2>How to Use Efficiency Ratios to Assess a Company’s Financial Health?</h2>
<p>Fundamental analysis involves a deep dive into assessing a company’s financial standing. Here’s where efficiency ratios come to the rescue. Simply put, efficiency ratios are metrics that are used in analyzing a company’s ability to effectively employ its resources to produce income.</p> 
<p>These ratios provide a comparison of the profit/revenue generated to the expenses incurred. The ratios serve as a comparison of expenses made to revenues generated, essentially reflecting what kind of return in revenue or profit a company can make from the amount it spends to operate its business.</p> 
<h3>Inventory Turnover Ratio</h3>
<p>Inventory turnover, or the inventory turnover ratio, is the number of times a business sells and replaces its stock of goods during a given period.</p>
<p>It considers the cost of goods sold, relative to its average inventory for a year or in any set period of time.</p> 
<p>A high inventory turnover generally means that goods are sold faster and a low turnover rate indicates weak sales and excess inventories, which may be challenging for a business. </p>
<p>Inventory Turnover Ratio =  (Cost of Goods Sold)/(Average Inventory)</p>
<h3>Asset Turnover Ratio</h3>
<p>The asset turnover ratio is an efficiency ratio that measures a company’s ability to generate sales from its assets by comparing net sales with average total assets. In other words, this ratio shows how efficiently a company can use its assets to generate sales.</p>
<p>The total asset turnover ratio calculates net sales as a percentage of assets to show how many sales are generated from each dollar of company assets. For instance, a ratio of 0.5 means that each rupee of assets generates 0.5 Rs of sales.</p> 

<p>Asset Turnover Ratio= Net Sales/Average Total Asset</p>
<h3>Accounts Payable Turnover Ratio</h3>
<p>The accounts payable turnover ratio, also known as the payables turnover or the creditor’s turnover ratio, is a liquidity ratio that measures the average number of times a company pays its creditors over an accounting period.</p> 
<p>The ratio is a measure of short-term liquidity. If the turnover ratio declines from one period to the next, this indicates that the company is paying its suppliers more slowly, and maybe an indicator of worsening financial condition.</p>
<p>A change in the turnover ratio can also indicate altered payment terms with suppliers, though this rarely has more than a slight impact on the ratio. </p>
<p>If a company is paying its suppliers very quickly, it may mean that the suppliers are demanding fast payment terms, or that the company is taking advantage of early payment discounts.</p>
<p>Accounts payables turnover ratio= net credit purchases/average accounts payables. </p>
<h3>Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio</h3>
<p>Accounts receivable turnover is the number of times per year that a business collects its average accounts receivable.</p>
<p>The ratio is used to evaluate the ability of a company to efficiently issue a credit to its customers and collect funds from them in a timely manner.</p>
<p> A high turnover ratio indicates a combination of a conservative credit policy and an aggressive collections department, as well as a number of high-quality customers. </p>
<p>A low turnover ratio represents an opportunity to collect excessively old accounts receivable that are unnecessarily tying up working capital.</p> 
<p>Low receivable turnover may be caused by a loose or nonexistent credit policy, and inadequate collections function, and/or a large proportion of customers having financial difficulties.</p> 
<p>It is also quite likely that a low turnover level indicates an excessive amount of bad debt. It is useful to track accounts receivable turnover on a trend line in order to see if turnover is slowing down; if so, an increase in funding for the collections staff may be required, or at least a review of why turnover is worsening.</p>
