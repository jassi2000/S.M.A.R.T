         <h2>How Gains from Intraday Trading are Taxed?</h2>
<p>If you are planning to start intraday trading, then you need to ensure that you understand the tax treatment of the trades to make informed decisions. While most investments have simple taxation norms, tax on intraday trades involves various aspects. Today, we will offer a detailed guide to help you understand tax on intraday trades.</p>
<h3>Understanding Capital Assets and Trading Assets</h3>
<p>A share can be held either as a capital asset or a trading asset (stock-in-trade). Understanding the difference between the two is important since the tax laws vary for each of them.</p>
<p>1. Capital Assets:</p>
<p>“As per Section 2 – Subsection 14 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a capital asset includes property of any kind held by an assessee, whether or not connected with his business or profession, but does not include any stock-in-trade or personal assets subject to certain exceptions.”</p>
<p>2. Trading Assets or Stocks-in-Trade:</p>
<p>These are stocks held by a day trader with the purpose of selling them.</p>
<p>How to define them?</p>
<p>In the past, there has been a lot of uncertainty regarding treating shares purchased via intraday trades as capital assets or trading assets. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had issued several circulars and instructions offering guidelines for the same. However, there was ambiguity regarding proving the intention of the stock purchase (for investment or trading) since the facts of each investor were different. Hence, the CBDT released a circular bringing clarity in classifying the same. According to the circular:</p>
<p>“Irrespective of the period of holding the shares, the assessee can opt to treat share purchases as capital assets or trading assets. Hence, income from these investments will be treated as either capital gains or business income. Also, for listed shares held for more than 12 months, if the assessee decides to treat the income from it as Capital Gains, then the Assessing Officer will permit it. However, the assessee will not be allowed to change this stand and take a different approach in subsequent years.”</p>
<h3>Speculative Business Income</h3>
<p>Section 43 – sub-section 5 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 defines a speculative transaction as ‘a transaction in which a contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity, including stocks and shares, is periodically or ultimately settled otherwise than by the actual delivery or transfer of the commodity or scrips.’ While there are some exceptions to this rule, intraday transactions are speculative in nature and hence, the income from these trades is called speculative business income.</p>
<h3>Non-Speculative Business Income</h3>
<p>In simple terms, all share transactions that are not speculative in nature fall under the category of non-speculative transactions. These include delivery-based equity trades, equity futures and options, commodity trades (both delivery and futures/options), and currency trades (both delivery and futures/options). Hence, the income from these transactions is called non-speculative business income.</p>
<h3>Tax Rules on Intraday Trades</h3>
<p>Summing up the concepts explained above, income from intraday equity trades is considered to be speculative business income. Additionally, if you are executing intraday trades in commodities and currencies, then the income from such trades is called non-speculative business income. Therefore, income from intraday trades is considered to be ‘business income’ and not ‘capital gain’.</p>
<h3>Tax Loss Harvesting</h3>
<p>While we have written a detailed blog on Tax Loss Harvesting that you can read for more details, here is something about this concept that you need to know while trying to understand the tax rules around intraday trades.</p>
<p>At the end of the financial year, you might have some unrealized gains and losses. While you pay tax on the realized gains, the unrealized losses are carried forward to the next financial year. In other words, while your portfolio might indicate lower profits, you might end up paying high taxes due to losses that have not yet been booked. This can eat away into your realized gains.</p>
<p>Many traders reduce their tax liability by booking the unrealized loss and immediately taking the same position in the stock. While this is not possible in an intraday trade, if you place delivery orders too, then this can be a great way to increase the non-speculative loss component and reduce your tax liability.</p>
<p>For example, if you have booked profits of Rs.10 lakh via intraday equity trades in a financial year and have unrealized losses in delivery-based trades of Rs.3 lakh, then by booking the loss, you can reduce your tax liability to Rs.7 lakh.</p>
<h3>Deducting business expenses</h3>
<p>When you declare a business income, the tax rules allow you to show all expenses incurred to earn that income as costs and deduct them from your taxable income. Also, if you book a loss, then you can carry forward these expenses too as losses. Here are some expenses that can be included as business expenses:</p>
<p> 1.Trading-related charges – brokerage, exchange-levied charges, etc.</p>
<p> 2.Internet costs (if you place online orders)</p>
<p> 3.Phone bill (if you call your broker for trades)</p>
<p> 4.Depreciation of your computer or any other electronic used for trading</p>
<p> 5.Rent paid if you use a space to execute the trades</p>
<p> 6.Salary or consultation fees paid to someone to help you trade</p>
<p> 7.Costs associated with advisory services</p>
<p> 8.Costs for books or magazine subscriptions to keep you informed, etc.</p>
<p> 1. Are BTST Trades speculative or non-speculative?</p>

<p>One of the fundamental ways of defining a speculative transaction in equity is determining if there is a delivery of shares associated with the trade or not. In intraday trades, there is no delivery and hence they are considered to be speculative. However, In Buy Today Sell Tomorrow (BTST) trades or Sell Today Buy Tomorrow (STBT) trades, the tax rules are a little grey.</p>
<p>Since in these trades, delivery is the net outcome despite the trader taking a short-term delivery risk, most people classify them as non-speculative business transactions. </p>
<p> 2. Do I need to pay Advance Tax on intraday trades?</p>

<p>According to the Income Tax laws, Advance Tax is mandatory for business income. This tax has to be paid as follows:</p>

   <p> 15% by June 15</p>
  <p>  45% by September 15</p>
  <p>  75% by December 15</p>
   <p> 100% by March 15</p>

<p>Tax is paid on income. So, what are these the percentages of? 15% of what? </p>

<p>This is the percentage of the tax that you are likely to pay in the financial year. So, you have to estimate the profits that you might earn in the FY, calculate tax, and pay Advance tax accordingly. However, when it comes to intraday trading, the problem is estimating how the rest of the year will be.</p>
<p> 3. Use the right ITR Form</p>

<p>There are various Income Tax Return (ITR) Forms available to suit different types of taxpayers. We recommend employing the services of a tax professional. However, if you want to file returns yourself, ensure that you choose the right ITR Form. The options available for individuals are as follows:</p>

<p>ITR 1</p>

<p>This is the most common type of ITR form used by individuals. It is for people with income from salary, rent from one house, and/or interest. However, if you have capital gains or business income, then this form is not applicable.</p>

<p>ITR 2</p>

<p>This is used by individuals and HUFs (non-business) to file returns for income from salary, rent from one house, interest, and/or capital gains. Hence, this is for people who opt for investment as a classification of their equity trades.</p>

<p>ITR 3 (erstwhile ITR 4)</p>

<p>This is used by individuals and HUFs (non-business) to file returns for income from salary, rent from one house, interest, capital gains, and/or business income. Hence, this is the ITR form that can be used by intraday traders. This form also allows you to file returns if you trade and invest in shares and have capital gains as well as business income.</p>

<p>ITR 4 (erstwhile ITR 4S)</p>

<p>This is similar to ITR 3 but can be used only if you use Sections 44AD and 44AE for computing business income. Remember, you cannot use this form to declare capital gains or carry forward losses.</p>
