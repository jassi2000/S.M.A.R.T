            <h2>Things to Know Before You Buy Fractional Shares</h2>
<p>When investors consider stock investments, they’re most likely thinking of a whole share. As they set their eyes on US stocks which cost significantly higher than their Indian counterparts, they tend to take a step back. </p>
<p>This happens mainly due to two reasons – investors either don’t have enough capital to diversify their portfolio or do not want to invest their entire savings in a single company.</p> 
<h3>What are Fractional Shares?</h3>
<p>The pie can be split into several pieces and each customer gets to take one or more of these delicious slices home.</p>
<p>Fractional shares are akin to the slices of a pie. A company’s stock, owing to various reasons, can be split into several fractions and you can choose to purchase only one of these pieces of a whole share. Consequently, you reap the returns from the appreciation of this particular fraction.</p>
<p>This way, limited capital no longer acts as a hindrance when it comes to investing in the shares of a company of the investor’s choice.</p>
<p>Fractional shares have garnered enormous popularity over the past few years owing to the advancements in brokerage technology.</p>
<h3>How are Fractional Shares Created?</h3>
<p>Fractional shares are created by way of some major decisions taken by a company such as mergers and acquisitions, stock splits and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are many brokerage firms who enable you to invest in fractional shares.</p>
<p>1. Stock Splits :

Stock splits may often produce an odd number of shares. Let’s say a company announces a 5-for-4 stock split. It would create 5 shares for every 4 shares owned by an investor.</p>
<p>2. Mergers and Acquisitions :

Fractional shares may be formed following mergers and acquisitions as companies merge to create new stocks with a predetermined ratio. </p>

<p>Let’s say Raj holds 7 shares in Company B, which is merging with company D. The companies decide to convert the shares 3-for-5 in their new company E.</p>
<p>Post-merger, Raj will become the owner of 4.2 shares of Company E. </p>
<p>3. Dividend Reinvestment Plans : 

Dividend Reinvestment Plans or DRIP offered by some companies, and brokerage firms often enable investors to utilise dividend pay-outs to purchase the same shares. </p>

<p>But sometimes the dividend amount might not be enough to purchase a full share. This can lead to the creation of fractional shares. </p>
<h3>Advantages of Fractional Shares </h3>
<p>Here are some advantages of fractional shares –</p>
<p>1. Ideal for Diversification :

As noted above, fractional shares make it possible for you to diversify your portfolio by investing in different companies. </p>

<p>By distributing your capital in the shares of different companies, you’ll be able to reduce the risks associated with the changing conditions. </p>
<p>2. Invest with Limited Resources :

Sometimes investing in the companies of your choice can be difficult if you have limited capital. But with fractional investing, you can eliminate this concern. </p>

<p>You don’t have to save up until you have enough money to buy a whole share. </p>

<p>For example, if the current market price of the shares of ABC Company is $800, you can buy a fraction of its share. You don’t have to wait until you save up $800!</p>
<p>3. Offers Flexibility to Investors : 

If you plan on buying whole shares, you have to set aside sufficient capital to buy them at the targeted price. </p>

<p>But fractional investing allows you to set a predetermined dollar amount you want to purchase and the shares will be allotted to you. </p>

<p>For example, if you plan on investing $4000 worth of Company A’s stock, priced at $103.29 per share, the smallest fractional share you’ll be eligible to buy is 0.01.</p>
<p>4. Feasible for New Investors:

As mentioned previously, fractional investing doesn’t require you to risk a lot of your funds. So if you’re relatively new to the market, investing in fractional shares can be the ideal option to maximize returns. </p> 

<p>If you have a capital of $2000, you can invest $400 in five different companies and distribute the risk.</p> 
<h3>Limitations of Fractional Investing</h3>
<p>Similar to other investment strategies, fractional investing is not free from its limitations. Few of its drawbacks include –</p>
<p>1. Inflated Prices :

Since fractional investing allows retail investors to buy shares, the prices of the expensive stocks might become inflated. </p>

<p>Investing in companies with inflated share prices often prove to be a poor investment decision in the long run.</p> 
<p>2. Difficulty in Trading :

Sometimes, the time required to buy fractionating shares can be higher than purchasing a whole share.</p>

<p>Also, the tax assessments of trading in such shares can occasionally give rise to unwarranted complications.</p>
