               <h2>From Bookstore to Superstore: Amazon Through the Years
    </h2>
    <p>Amazon is one of the few brands that every person on this planet who has ever used the internet is aware of. But what is Amazon? Is it just an e-commerce giant? Or a retail service provider? To be fair, Amazon is an amalgamation of businesses that defy all norms. It has grown to a scale that it is impossible to imagine how it manages to maintain its service standards even today. There is a lot more to Amazon than what meets the eye.</p>

<p>Most people know that Amazon is an ecommerce behemoth. However, from an online single-cell bookseller to having almost every product under the sun, it has come a long way. Here is a look at the journey of this mega-brand:</p>

<p><b>1994 </b></p>

<p>Jeff Bezos launched an online bookstore in July 1994 called Amazon from the garage of his rented home in Washington. He had a vision of making the company “An Everything Store.” A visionary and entrepreneur at heart, Bezos started Amazon when he was 30 years old.</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos had initially thought of naming the company ‘Cadabra’ (think abracadabra). However, his lawyer convinced him that the name sounded more like ‘cadaver’ (corpse). Hence, the name was dropped. Bezos then thought of naming the company ‘Relentless’. Finally, he decided on Amazon after the largest river in the world. By the way, if you type www.relentless.com, guess where you will land!</p>

<p>Initially, Amazon’s sales were limited to word-of-mouth publicity only. In fact, for the first few orders, Bezos and his employees used to drive down to the post offices to deliver the packages themselves.</p>

<p><b>1996</b></p>

<p>Bezos reincorporated the company in Delaware. Its customer base grew to around 1.8 lakh with annual revenues of around $16 million.</p>

<p><b>1997 </b></p>

<p>By 1997, the company’s annual revenues had seen a massive jump to $148 million. Amazon was still a private company. However, Bezos realized that he needed more funds to sustain the long-term trajectory and decided to go public. On May 15, 1997, Amazon issued an IPO at $18 per share under the symbol AMZN on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The IPO raised $54 million.</p>

<p>Just before the listing, Barnes & Noble sued Amazon alleging that Amazon’s claim of being the world’s largest bookstore was false since it was a book broker and not a bookstore. It was settled out of court and Amazon continued making the claim. </p>

<p>This year, Amazon also delivered its one-millionth order. This was a buyer in Japan who had purchased a Windows NT machine and the biography of Princess Diana. Jeff Bezos personally delivered this to the buyer.</p>

<p>AMZN: Listed at $18 per share</p>

<p>After adjusting for a few stock splits, the stock finally closed at $1.96 on their first trading day.</p>

<p>1998: Amazon Expands into Music and Computer Games</p>

<p>In 1998, Amazon had included music and computer games to the list of products offered via its online store. The music section was launched with around 125,000 titles which were far more than what a brick and mortar music store offered. Also, people could listen to clips before buying and get recommendations based on their mood.</p>

<p><b>June 11, 1998</b></p>

<p>AMZN: $10.42 per share</p>

<p><b>1999</b></p>

<p>By 1999, Amazon had already expanded into selling video games, home-improvement items, consumer electronics software, games, and much more. Bezos wanted to catch up with his motto of “get big fast”. By the end of the year, Amazon had shipped to around 150 countries around the globe. It was shaping into a global online store.</p>

<p>The Times Magazine named Jeff Bezos Person of the Year in 1999.</p>

<p><b>December 10, 1999</b></p>

<p>AMZN: $106.69 per share</p>

<p><b>2000 & 2001</b></p>

<p>In 2000, Amazon started permitting individual sellers and merchants to sell their products next to its own items. Further, there was a change in Amazon’s logo with the curved arrow featuring from A to Z. This was a representation of the fact that Amazon now carries all products from A to Z with a smile (the arrow curved like a smile). However, the company did not stat churning profits until late 2001. The beginning of the 21st century brought with itself the dot-com bubble. While it destroyed many e-commerce companies, Amazon grew past it and became one of the biggest names in online sales. </p>
