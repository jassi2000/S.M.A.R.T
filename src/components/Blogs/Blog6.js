            <h2>How are Bond Yields and Stock Markets Related to Each Other?</h2>
<p>Time and again a movement in bond yields has impacted the stock markets. More often than not, the two move in opposite directions. The impact and the relationship can be witnessed across borders as well. Not just domestic bond yields, a movement in U.S. bond yields have also affected stock markets back home. A rally in the Indian markets had taken place due to a sudden increase in U.S. bond yields during March 2021. </p>
<h3>Relationship Between Bond Yields And Stock Market</h3>
<p>1. Bond Yields And Cost Of capital:</p>
<p>Higher government bond yields would mean that the borrowing costs for companies have increased. Bond yields are usually used as the risk-free rate when calculating the cost of borrowing capital. When bond yields go up, the cost of borrowing also increases.</p>
<p>When it becomes more expensive for a company to borrow money to sustain its business, it impacts the companyâ€™s valuation and stock performance. Expensive borrowing also means lesser funds are available with the company to give out as dividends.</p> 
<p>2. Opportunity cost:</p>
<p>Another way to look at the relationship between the two is the opportunity cost to invest in them. When one investment opportunity becomes more attractive, if you invest in any other non-attractive product, you are basically losing out on the opportunity to get better returns and in some way, paying an opportunity cost.</p> 
<p>3. Bond Yields And Foreign Funds:</p>
<p>If bond yields go up, it makes the debt market more attractive. Say Indian bond yields, at a certain time, are offering better yields than the global market, global investors will find Indian debt more attractive than global debt. Again, if the debt market looks more attractive than equities, foreign institutional investors (FII) flows will be bent towards equities. The concept of opportunity costs comes into play again.</p>
<h3>What Is Meant By Bond And Bond Yield?</h3>
<p>If you purchase a bond, it means you are lending money to the bond issuers. The bond issuers have agreed to pay you interest during the lifetime of the bond. Bond issuers need to repay you the principal value upon the maturity of that bond.</p>
<p>Yield is the effective rate of return you receive on maturity after selling the bond. When yield is calculated beforehand, it is assumed that the bond is held till maturity.</p>
<p>A bond also pays you an annual return known as coupon payments which are mostly fixed.</p>
<p>Bond yields and bond prices are inversely related to each other. When bond yields rise, the price of existing bonds goes down. This is because higher yields make the new bond more attractive than the older bonds offering lower </p>
