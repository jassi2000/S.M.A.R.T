            <h2>How to Create a Day Trading Plan?</h2>
<p>Theoretically, intraday trading is all about buying low and selling high – all within the same day. It is about identifying opportunities in the market. These opportunities can be for a particular stock, sector, or the market as a whole. The success of an intraday trader lies in identifying them and taking the right position at the right time.</p>
<p>However, the reality is much more complicated. As a day trader identifying markets/opportunities, managing risks, and exiting positions at the right time play a significant role in your success. </p>
<p>One of the biggest roadblocks that intraday traders have to face is a tendency to get swayed by the market sentiment. While some traders get swayed in the direction of the sentiment, others sway in the opposite direction.</p>
<h3>Risk Comes First</h3>
<p>Risk tolerance. This is a common term heard across investing and trading circles. However, what is risk tolerance and why is it important?</p>
<p>Every investment comes with associated risks. So, if you are buying shares, then the price of the share can get influenced by various factors like the country’s economic, social, and political situation, the company’s performance, etc. If the government makes a sudden policy change affecting the industry where you are heavily invested, then the share price will respond either in favor of or against you. </p>
<p>Risk tolerance is about the amount of risk you can take without getting too worried and making emotion-driven decisions. While long-term investors have time to allow the share prices to move up, day traders barely have a few hours.</p>
<h3>Create and Implement Rules for Risk Management (Entry & Exit Levels)</h3>
<p>While on the topic of risks, let’s talk about risk management too. A day trader without a strategic risk management plan is like a deep-sea diver without his gear – he is bound to fail. Risk management is primarily the difference between gambling and intraday trading.</p>
<p>This plan will help you have a bird’s-eye view of the overall risks of your trades, potential losses, etc. In layman terms, risk management is about knowing when to exit a position – how much loss are you willing to take and after how much profit you would quit. </p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>Let’s say that you buy shares worth Rs.10000. The price of the claim is Rs.100, and you have purchased 100 shares. You are expecting the share price to rise. After your purchase, the share price increases to Rs.105. Do you book the profit or wait for it to rise further? It reaches 107. If you sell now, you can book a profit of Rs.700 on investment of Rs.10000 within a day. Should you sell or wait? After an hour or market activity, the share price drops to Rs.104. What do you do now? Sell and book profits or wait for it to reach Rs.107 again and sell? The share price now drops to Rs.101. No point selling it now, right? Or, is it? Before you realize, the share price drops to Rs.95 and looks like it will fall further. Should you sell it and limit your losses? By the end of the trading day, the share price nosedives to Rs.60 per share. You finally exit your position at a 40% loss from what could have been a 7% profit.</p>
<h3>Choose Your Day Trading Style</h3>
<p>There are primarily two approaches taken by day traders to create a trading plan:</p>
<p> 1. Scalping – This is a fast-paced trading approach. As the name suggests, day traders who take this approach look to book small profits or losses within a small time. They buy/sell stock and square it off within minutes. This approach requires you to understand minute stock price movements and capitalize on them. It is all about timing. Also, to make reasonable profits, you would need a favourable brokerage plan and place a large number of orders in the day.</p>
<p> 2. Regular day trading – This approach is about opening a position during the first half of the day and closing it by the end of the day. This involves a better understanding of the macroeconomic conditions that can impact the markets/sector(s). It is about identifying a potential trend and taking a position accordingly.</p>
<h3>Learn How to Read Charts</h3>
<p>As a day trader, you will want to look at the open, close, high, low, and last closing price of a share before investing. This information is essential to make an informed trading decision.</p>

<p>There are various types of charts used by traders like line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. Of these, most traders prefer the candlestick charts as they offer detailed information in an easy-to-understand manner.</p>
<h3>Understand Market Correlations</h3>
<p>If anything, history teaches us what to expect from the future. Even if it is not 100%, it gives you a good place to start. This is the basis of the concept of market correlation. </p>
<p>For example, what if I was to tell you that every time the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) rallies, the BSE rallies too (at least more often than not).</p> 
<h3>Build the Perfect Trading Plan </h3>
<p> 1. Where do you stand? – Intraday trading is a fast-paced activity. Hence, your skill levels will matter when you have to make split-second decisions. Before you create a trading plan, do some paper trading (dummy trading) to assess how your skills stand up to the markets. Ensure that your trading plan is based on your skills and not a perception.</p>
<p> 2. Create emotional filters – Yes, you read that right. Successful day traders stay away from the markets if they are not emotionally or psychologically up for the challenge. Identify your emotional triggers and how you react to them and ensure that you filter out days when you are not at your best.</p>
<p> 3. Determine risk-per-trade – While we have spoken about risk management and risk-reward ratio, you also need to ensure that you don’t expose your portfolio to too much risk in one trade alone. Many day traders lose a fortune by over-investing in a position. Regardless of the confidence you have in the position, markets are unpredictable. Hence, determine the maximum percentage of your trading portfolio that you will expose to risk in one trade.</p>
<p> 4. Be realistic – Who wouldn’t want to invest Rs.100 and make thousands out of it. In fact, the internet is always abuzz with such stories and claims to strategies that can make millionaires out of anyone. While we would love to see all our investors as millionaires, it is important to remain realistic while setting expectations from the markets. </p>
<p> 5. Be an informed trader – Day traders are aware of what is happening in the world. They watch the news, list to government policy changes, keep a watch on any political events (domestic or international), stay aware of social situations, etc. Being informed can give you an edge over other traders who tend to follow than take initiative and pre-empt a market movement.</p>
<p> 6. Choose a day trading strategy/strategies – There are various strategies adopted by day traders. While each of them will require some practice, it can help you approach trading in a more structured manner. You can read about some popular strategies in our blog ‘Introduction to Intraday Trading Strategies’.</p>
<p> 7. Set Entry/Exit Rules – As explained above, it is important to set entry/exit rules to help you make data-driven decisions and steer clear of emotions clouding your judgment. As a day trader, it is important to remember that sometimes the market sentiment can benefit you, and sometimes it can take you south. Hence, setting entry/exit rules is important to keep your trades price-driven and not sentiment-driven.</p>
<p> 8. Maintain records of your trades – Successful day trading involves learning from your mistakes and triumphs. If you win, then you should know what you did right so that you can replicate the process. On the other hand, if you lose, then analyzing your trades can help you identify the why’s and how’s and allow you to prevent repeating them. It can also help you understand which strategy or approach worked for you in the past and whether you need to re-look at something to be more successful in the future.</p>
